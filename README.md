This UI design was created as an initial concept at the early stage of the project. It represents the ideal user interface and experience we aimed to build for the EMS application.

However, please note that we were not able to fully implement this design in the final product due to:

Limited development resources

Technical and operational constraints

Platform-specific restrictions

While this file remains part of the repo for reference and documentation purposes, the final implementation may differ significantly from this design.
